Case studies evaluating the evidence of known, clinically-relevant pediatric adverse drug effects using the PDSportal database

## Overview

Pediatricians adhere to guidelines based on the best available evidence when prescribing medications to their patients. However, the evidence on medication safety can be biased due to inaccurate extrapolation from adult studies and under-powered, development-agnostic associations from pediatric clinical trials. Thus, drug safety information for children is often limited or incomplete, which can result in severe adverse reactions. In response, we developed a data-driven approach that generated an accessible database that estimates drug risks from all observed side effects across child development.

## Notebook

This repository stores a notebook showcasing example analyses in a series of case studies investigating pediatric adverse drug effects. These were used in writing dissertation material. The notebook is made available to show code to perform similar investigations. 

## Database

Download the database:
